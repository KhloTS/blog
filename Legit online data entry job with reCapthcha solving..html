There is also the high risk of being scammed with fake work with no payment (remember the rule if you have to pay first to start working for them then you are being scammed, especially with data entry works). But what if i tell you that despite your location disadvantage&nbsp; on the planet you can still earn money online consistently and good amount as well (20$ a week), provided you have an internet connection and a computer or smartphone to access the internet of course. The type of work i'm talking about is captcha solving. If you haven't heard of it, i'll explain below. And for those who is at their wits ends with finding a stable online job with low skill<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">, then give captcha solving a try. Also let me just say this before you read further, this is not a get rich quick kind of job, afterall it is a low skill job.</span></p><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are hundreds of sites where you can work as a reCaptcha (or captcha) solver but only few of the sites pay genuinely &amp; regularly to their members.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I haven't tried all of them but here are some that i have found works worldwide even for third world countries and pays regularly (provided you reach the minimum payment amount). </span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Some of the websites includes 2Captchas, Kolotibablo, Megatypers etc &amp; based on the ratings, I have selected some of the top captcha work sites where you can join and make decent (if not much) money.</span></div><p></p><p></p><div>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is Online reCAPTCHA solving Jobs &amp; how you can earn from this?.&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">I am sure you have at least basic knowledge of internet if you are reading this article.

They can create the automatic software to signup on the websites but there is no technology to solve these captcha automatically.  And that is where they need human to solve these reCaptchas</span><span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">.</span></div><div><br></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 1.2rem;">When their software create accounts on these sites, they come across reCaptcha &amp; send that reCaptcha image to the reCaptcha solver. You have very short time to select the exact images provided in the image &amp; you must have good accuracy to solve these images.</span></div><div>

</div><div>

</div><div>
</div><div>You need to create your account on PayPal or Payza or other websites before you join these sites so that you can receive your earnings promptly.
