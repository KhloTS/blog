</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>Important Points Before You Work on These Captcha Sites
</p><p>Captcha work is not something where you can make some big income. This is a laborious job &amp; the money you make here is very less. You can earn around $100 to $300 (Rs. 6000/- to Rs. 20,000/-) per month if you work at least 4 hrs daily.
</p><p><br></p><p>Some of the capthca work websites will ask you to download the software &amp; you need to type the captchas after logged in to these software.
</p><p>You need to create your account on PayPal or Payza or other websites before you join these sites so that you can receive your earnings promptly.
</p><p><br></p><p>Hope this article will help those who are not looking for big money making opportunities. This is a good online data entry job for you if even $100 is a very decent income for you.</p></div>
